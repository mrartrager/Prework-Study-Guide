# prework-study-guide

## Description

I wanted to build a Prework Study guide for a few reasons. One of them being, a prework study guide is a great way to keep track of everything that I have been learning and practicing on so far. Another reason why I built this Pre work study guide is the fact that this was a good practice run on "how to think like a developer". A big part of my motivation was learing what a growth mindset was and then applying that mindset actively through this workshop.  

There were definatily some big issues that came up for me. The biggest was setting up my SSH Key correctly through gitbash and syncing it with my GitHub account, after trial and error I finally was able to figure it out, but also still not 100% understanding how I got it to work if I'm being honest. 

I learned quite a lot building this simple study guide webpage. I learned the basics of HTML tags, and creating an un ordered lists. I learned how to style certain aspects of the webpage using some basic CSS skills, and then tied it all together by learning how to make a randomized subject selector in the chrome devtools console log, using JavaScript.

## Usage

The Prework-study-guide is quite simple to use, but just to be safe I'll walk you throuhg on how to use it. The website includes everything you need on one page. Each section is broken up into there own individual box. Each box contains subject notes for certain aspects that were taught on that speceifc subject. See HTML, to see notes on HTML, See CSS to see notes on CSS, the same applies for JavaScript and Git. There also is a cool subject selector in the Devtools. If you're unsure what to study today, you can open the console log in the chrome Devtools and refresh the page, that will show which of the 4 subejcts you could study today!
